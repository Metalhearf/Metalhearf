I’ve spent over a decade building, securing, and maintaining infrastructures, from small self-hosted setups to large-scale **AWS** environments. I love deploying and automating stuff, optimizing systems and keeping things **lean, private, and under control**.

When I’m not breaking or fixing things, I’m usually exploring new tools, tweaking configs, or writing on my ✨ [**blog**](https://metalhearf.fr) ✨ about **Linux**, **self-hosting**, and **privacy**.
